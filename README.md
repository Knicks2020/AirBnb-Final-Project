# AirBnb Final Project

 ## TOPIC
 * Selected topic 
    * AirBnb rentals in Orlando, Kissimmee & Tampa
 * Reason why they selected their topic 
    * We chose this topic so that we could do a market analysis on the current state of AirBnB rentals in our target area,
and also hopefully determine what factors impact whether or not the property is rented on a consistent basis.
We have a desire to purchase property specifically for an AirBnb so we also want to determine the overhead costs and then 
hopefully determine a reasonable expected rate of return.
