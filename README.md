## Air Bnb Presentation

### Dashboard

For our dashboard we chose to use Tableau.  We felt that Tableau provided us with a vareity of options when it comes to visual analytics. We also feel that we are able to build dashboards and perform analyses very easily.  I contemplated using Microsoft Power BI (PBI) for this project.  PBI however does not appear to offer a user a opportunity to share their dashboard with others for free.  I also feel that building a calculated field in Tableau is more user friendly than the DAX calculatioins that need to be performed in PBI in to order to manipulate certain data.
The dashboard is till be modified, however you are free to use the link below to access it at your leisure.
