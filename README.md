# AirBnb-Final-Project

 * Selected topic 
    * AirBnb rentals in Orlando, Kissimmee & Tampa
 * Reason why they selected their topic 
    * We chose this topic so that we could do a market analysis on the current state of AirBnB rentals in our target area,
and also hopefully determine what factors impact whether or not the property is rented on a consistent basis.
We have a desire to purchase property specifically for an AirBnb so we also want to determine the overhead costs and then 
hopefully determine a reasonable expected rate of return.
 * Description of their source of data 
    * Our data was taken from [MashVisor.com](https://www.mashvisor.com/).  This website provides us with data to analyze short term or long term rental prospects.  The site provides us with an abundance of data that includes pricing, location, square footage, etc. 
 * Questions they hope to answer with the data
    * What is Success for an AirBnB rental?
    * Using a threshold of 200+ nights per year occupancy, is the AirBnb rental operating successfully?
    * What factors contribute to that success? (# of pics, key words in description, rating, location, etc.)
