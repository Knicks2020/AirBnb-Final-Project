# Machine-Learning

## Overview

In order to determine the success or failure of Airbnb properties we will be using a Linear Model. Based on our cleaned dataset we will examine the number of nights booked and it's overall effect on revenue generated by the property. It is expected that there will be a clear correlation between these two measures.

## First Round of Machine Learning

Our initial linear model was achieved using the following code and rendered a scatter plot that indicates the rate at which nights booked can generate revenue. Please review the code and model shown below.
